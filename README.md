# Scikit-learn-dairy
In the repository, we will be discussing about all the scikit-learn libraries.

For training the model we use various Machine Learning Algorithms to get accuracy and perform the better predictions
Here I have discussed various machine algorithms:
- Very first file is about the SVM algorithm
