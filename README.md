# Scikit-learn-dairy
In the repository, we will be discussing about all the scikit-learn libraries.

## Introduction to Support Vector Machine
- Before starting with SVM, we should take a look on what is Supervised Machine Learning- It is an algorithm used for classification and regression analysis. It finds a hyperplane that creates a boundary between two types of data.
- SVM can only be performed in **binary classiification**.
- For non-linearly separable data we use **Kernalized SVM**
- **Kernel** is a measurement of similarity between the data points. The kernel function in a kernelized SVM tells that given two data points in the original feature space.
### Important parameters in Kernalized SVC
- Kernel
- Gamma and
- The 'C' parameter
### Running SVM algorithm in Jupyter notebook
- Before writing the SVM algorithm, first install the scikit-learn- **!pip install -U scikit-learn**
